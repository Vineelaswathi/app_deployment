LeNet(1998):
	Optical Character Recognition - Only charecters identification(Alphabet detection)
	Doesn't do well for the coloured images also
	Reason:
		The lack of depth of the neural network
		Slow learning
		Usage of tanh in all LeNet is the major drawback (because of this Tanh activation function there are high chances that we undergo vanishing gradient decent problem.)
		The model is so simple and requires huge training data set

AlexNet(2012):
    First model that uses GPU and uses Relu activation function
	Takes less time than LeNet
	Disadvantages:
		Compared to other models depth is less so there are other models which are amazing than Alex
