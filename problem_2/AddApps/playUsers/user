LeNet(1998):
	Optical Character Recognition - Only charecters identification(Alphabet detection)
	Doesn't do well for the coloured images also
	Reason:
		The lack of depth of the neural network
		Slow learning
		Usage of tanh in all LeNet is the major drawback (because of this Tanh activation function there are high chances that we undergo vanishing gradient decent problem.)
		The model is so simple and requires huge training data set

AlexNet(2012):
    First model that uses GPU and uses Relu activation function
	Takes less time than LeNet
	Disadvantages:
		Compared to other models depth is less so there are other models which are amazing than Alex

VGG(2014):
	VGG primary focus is to attain good accuracy in less time
	Disadvantages:
		Though the best accuracy has been attained in less time the loss is more unstable
		It takes more time to reach the local minima since there are many fluctuations in the loss
		Explosion gradient decent is the major problem in vgg

ResNet(2015):
	When compared to other models ResNet is very fast and can attain great accuracy in less time
	Disadvantages:
	Increasing the number of layers beyond 20 the model unable to converge at local minima
	At some point there is no change in weights and due to which it accounts for Vanishing Gradienyt Decent
	Advantages:
	Very fast in terms of accuracy and less training time
